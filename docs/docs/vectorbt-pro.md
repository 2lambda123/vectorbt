# vectorbt PRO

Hi, I'm [@polakowo](https://github.com/polakowo), the author of the library. As you might have noticed, 
vectorbt is an incredibly complex library, which addresses slow backtesting by an innovative approach. 
Since there is nothing comparable in the Open Source, most of the tools were designed and developed from scratch. 
The codebase has grown to some mind-blowing 40k lines of code (excluding the documentation), which already 
matches some high-tier corporate projects. While vectorbt steadily gains in popularity, maintaining this 
beast on my own is getting more difficult and expensive than ever.

But here's the deal. To make the development economically feasible, I'm launching a proprietary sister 
project [vectorbt PRO](https://vectorbt.pro/) that will become available on a subscription basis. 
The project should be seen as a successor to vectorbt - it's actively developed, will receive proper documentation, 
and there is a Discord server for discussions and announcements. If you want to be part of the new growing 
community and get access to cutting-edge software, complete a sponsorship on 
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/polakowo). As always, happy coding!
