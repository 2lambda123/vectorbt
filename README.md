# vectorbt

![Made by Vectors Market](logo.png)

This package shares a similar idea as behind [most other Python backtesting packages](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader#alternatives), but designed especially for fast strategy backtesting, tuning and comparison at scale. 

It combines numpy and Numba magic to obtain orders-of-magnitude speedup over pandas. Furthermore, it integrates [plotly.py](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) to build interactive charts and complex dashboards. Due to its high processing performance, vectorbt is able to re-calculate data on the fly, thus enabling the user to interact with data-hungry widgets without significant delays.

Here a snippet for testing 4851 window combinations of a dual SMA crossover strategy on the whole Microsoft stock history in about 5 seconds:

```python
import vectorbt as vbt
import numpy as np
import itertools
import yfinance as yf

# Prepare data
msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")
history = msft.history(period="max")
ohlcv = vbt.OHLCV.from_df(history)
investment = 100 # $

# Create window combinations
windows = np.arange(2, 101)
comb = itertools.combinations(np.arange(len(windows)), 2) # twice less params
fast_idxs, slow_idxs = np.asarray(list(comb)).transpose()
fast_windows, slow_windows = windows[fast_idxs], windows[slow_idxs]

# Calculate the performance of the strategy
dmac = vbt.DMAC(ohlcv.open, fast_windows, slow_windows)
entries, exits = dmac.crossover_signals()
positions = vbt.Positions.from_signals(entries, exits)
portfolio = vbt.Portfolio(ohlcv.open, positions, investment=investment)
tnp = portfolio.total_net_profit

# Plot heatmap
tnp_matrix = np.empty((len(windows), len(windows)))
tnp_matrix[fast_idxs, slow_idxs] = tnp
tnp_matrix[slow_idxs, fast_idxs] = tnp # symmetry

vbt.Heatmap(data=tnp_matrix, x_labels=windows, y_labels=windows, width=600, height=450).show_png()
```

## Motivation

While other backtesting packages or even pandas may be sufficient to run a handful number of tests, they have their limits in testing large amounts of strategies and hyperparameters. Take pandas for example: while certain pandas functionality such as rolling windows is implemented in both Cython and Numba, it cannot be accessed within user-defined Numba code. Moreover, some pandas operations may be extremely slow compared to their NumPy counterparts.

```
a = np.arange(100)
s = pd.Series(a)

%timeit a[i]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 998 ns per loop

%timeit s[i]
10000 loops, best of 3: 168 Âµs per loop
```

The idea behind vectorbt is to create a backtesting library that operates entirely on NumPy arrays and is powered by Numba. Thanks to the iterative nature of backtesting, you can either try to vectorize your code, or simply wrap your loops with Numba and execute your strategy without leaving the compiled code. Finally, vectorbt is a library, not a framework: you can easily replace/extend functions or mix the whole thing with pandas.

## How it works?

Each vectorbt class is a subclass of `np.ndarray` with a custom set of methods optimized for working with time series data. For example, the `Signals` class is a binary NumPy array supporting advanced binary operations. Each method is either vectorized or Numba compiled for best peformance; most of the times even a badly "looped" Numba is faster than vectorized NumPy though. Moreover, each class stricly accepts a 2-dimensional array, where first axis is index (time) and second axis are columns (features), and provides standardized methods for processing 2-dimensional data along first axis. Thus, similar to a `pd.DataFrame`, one can do a single operation to transform tons of columns simultaneously. This, for example, is the magic behind backtesting thousands of window combinations at once.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt.git
```

Note: importing vectorbt for the first time may take a while due to compilation.
